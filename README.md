# Codewars Solutions

This repository contains my JavaScript solutions to [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) challenges, organized by difficulty level (kyu).

## Structure

Each kyu folder contains `.js` files named after their corresponding Codewars challenge. These files include my personal solution, as well as the instructions for each challenge.
